    This implementation uses the Shamir-Strauss algorithm,

    Strauss algorithm consists of a single 'double & add' loop
    for the parallel calculation of u*H and v*Q,
    efficiently using a single 'doubling' for both scalar multiplication.

    The Shamir trick adds the precomputation of H+Q,
    which is to be added in the loop when the binary digits
    of u and v are both equal to 1 (on average 1/4 of the cases).

    The input points are assumed to be on curve,
    the u and v coefficients are assumed to have been reduced mod n
    if appropriate (e.g. cyclic groups of order n).
